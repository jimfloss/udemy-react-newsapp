Most commonly\n\t * it's used to animate the mounting and unmounting of a component, but can also\n\t * be used to describe in-place transition states as well.\n\t *\n\t * By default the `Transition` component does not alter the behavior of the\n\t * component it renders, it only tracks \"enter\" and \"exit\" states for the components.\n\t * It's up to you to give meaning and effect to those states. For example we can\n\t * add styles to a component when it enters or exits:\n\t *\n\t * ```jsx\n\t * import Transition from 'react-transition-group/Transition';\n\t *\n\t * const duration = 300;\n\t *\n\t * const defaultStyle = {\n\t *   transition: `opacity ${duration}ms ease-in-out`,\n\t *   opacity: 0,\n\t * }\n\t *\n\t * const transitionStyles = {\n\t *   entering: { opacity: 0 },\n\t *   entered:  { opacity: 1 },\n\t * };\n\t *\n\t * const Fade = ({ in: inProp }) => (\n\t *   <Transition in={inProp} timeout={duration}>\n\t *     {(state) => (\n\t *       <div style={{\n\t *         ...defaultStyle,\n\t *         ...transitionStyles[state]\n\t *       }}>\n\t *         I'm A fade Transition!\n\t *       </div>\n\t *     )}\n\t *   </Transition>\n\t * );\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * As noted the `Transition` component doesn't _do_ anything by itself to its child component.\n\t * What it does do is track transition states over time so you can update the\n\t * component (such as by adding styles or classes) when it changes states.\n\t *\n\t * There are 4 main states a Transition can be in:\n\t *  - `ENTERING`\n\t *  - `ENTERED`\n\t *  - `EXITING`\n\t *  - `EXITED`\n\t *\n\t * Transition state is toggled via the `in` prop. When `true` the component begins the\n\t * \"Enter\" stage. During this stage, the component will shift from its current transition state,\n\t * to `'entering'` for the duration of the transition and then to the `'entered'` stage once\n\t * it's complete. Let's take the following example:\n\t *\n\t * ```jsx\n\t * state= { in: false };\n\t *\n\t * toggleEnterState = () => {\n\t *   this.setState({ in: true });\n\t * }\n\t *\n\t * render() {\n\t *   return (\n\t *     <div>\n\t *       <Transition in={this.state.in} timeout={500} />\n\t *       <button onClick={this.toggleEnterState}>Click to Enter</button>\n\t *     </div>\n\t *   );\n\t * }\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * When the button is clicked the component will shift to the `'entering'` state and\n\t * stay there for 500ms (the value of `timeout`) when finally switches to `'entered'`.\n\t *\n\t * When `in` is `false` the same thing happens except the state moves from `'exiting'` to `'exited'`.\n\t */\n\t\n\tvar Transition = function (_React$Component) {\n\t  _inherits(Transition, _React$Component);\n\t\n\t  function Transition(props, context) {\n\t    _classCallCheck(this, Transition);\n\t\n\t    var _this = _possibleConstructorReturn(this, _React$Component.call(this, props, context));\n\t\n\t    var parentGroup = context.transitionGroup;\n\t    // In the context of a TransitionGroup all enters are really appears\n\t    var appear = parentGroup && !parentGroup.isMounting ?

Most commonly\n * it's used to animate the mounting and unmounting of a component, but can also\n * be used to describe in-place transition states as well.\n *\n * By default the `Transition` component does not alter the behavior of the\n * component it renders, it only tracks \"enter\" and \"exit\" states for the components.\n * It's up to you to give meaning and effect to those states. For example we can\n * add styles to a component when it enters or exits:\n *\n * ```jsx\n * import Transition from 'react-transition-group/Transition';\n *\n * const duration = 300;\n *\n * const defaultStyle = {\n *   transition: `opacity ${duration}ms ease-in-out`,\n *   opacity: 0,\n * }\n *\n * const transitionStyles = {\n *   entering: { opacity: 0 },\n *   entered:  { opacity: 1 },\n * };\n *\n * const Fade = ({ in: inProp }) => (\n *   <Transition in={inProp} timeout={duration}>\n *     {(state) => (\n *       <div style={{\n *         ...defaultStyle,\n *         ...transitionStyles[state]\n *       }}>\n *         I'm A fade Transition!\n *       </div>\n *     )}\n *   </Transition>\n * );\n * ```\n *\n * As noted the `Transition` component doesn't _do_ anything by itself to its child component.\n * What it does do is track transition states over time so you can update the\n * component (such as by adding styles or classes) when it changes states.\n *\n * There are 4 main states a Transition can be in:\n *  - `ENTERING`\n *  - `ENTERED`\n *  - `EXITING`\n *  - `EXITED`\n *\n * Transition state is toggled via the `in` prop. When `true` the component begins the\n * \"Enter\" stage. During this stage, the component will shift from its current transition state,\n * to `'entering'` for the duration of the transition and then to the `'entered'` stage once\n * it's complete. Let's take the following example:\n *\n * ```jsx\n * state= { in: false };\n *\n * toggleEnterState = () => {\n *   this.setState({ in: true });\n * }\n *\n * render() {\n *   return (\n *     <div>\n *       <Transition in={this.state.in} timeout={500} />\n *       <button onClick={this.toggleEnterState}>Click to Enter</button>\n *     </div>\n *   );\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * When the button is clicked the component will shift to the `'entering'` state and\n * stay there for 500ms (the value of `timeout`) when finally switches to `'entered'`.\n *\n * When `in` is `false` the same thing happens except the state moves from `'exiting'` to `'exited'`.\n */\n\nvar Transition = function (_React$Component) {\n  _inherits(Transition, _React$Component);\n\n  function Transition(props, context) {\n    _classCallCheck(this, Transition);\n\n    var _this = _possibleConstructorReturn(this, _React$Component.call(this, props, context));\n\n    var parentGroup = context.transitionGroup;\n    // In the context of a TransitionGroup all enters are really appears\n    var appear = parentGroup && !parentGroup.isMounting ?
